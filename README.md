## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for "Loca Device Tracker"
3. Enter your Loca API credentials:
   - **API Key**: Your Loca API key (obtained from Loca support)
   - **Username**: Your Loca account username
   - **Password**: Your Loca account password
4. Click **Submit**

The integration will automatically discover all devices associated with your account.

### Configuration Options

The integration supports the following configuration options:

#### API Settings
- **API Key** (required): Your unique Loca API key
  - Contact Loca support to obtain this key
  - Must be a valid alphanumeric string
- **Username** (required): Your Loca account username
  - Must match your registered Loca account
- **Password** (required): Your Loca account password
  - Must match your registered Loca account

#### Advanced Settings
- **Update Interval**: Device data refresh rate (default: 60 seconds)
  - Minimum recommended: 30 seconds
  - Maximum recommended: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  - Lower values increase API usage but provide more frequent updates

#### Device Discovery
- The integration automatically discovers all GPS devices linked to your account
- Devices appear as both device trackers and sensors
- Device names are taken from your Loca device configuration
- If no name is set, devices use the format "Loca Device [ID]"

#### Supported Device Types
- All Loca GPS tracking devices
- Both personal and fleet tracking devices
- Devices with GPS and cellular (LBS) positioning

### Reconfiguration

To modify settings after initial setup:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find your Loca integration
3. Click **Configure**
4. Update your credentials or settings
5. Click **Submit** to save changes

### Reauthentication

If your Loca credentials change or expire:
1. Home Assistant will automatically detect authentication failures
2. A notification will appear prompting you to update credentials
3. Click the notification and enter your new credentials
4. The integration will automatically reload with the new settings

### Multiple Accounts

You can add multiple Loca accounts:
1. Repeat the initial setup process
2. Each account creates a separate integration instance
3. Devices from different accounts are kept separate
4. Services can target specific accounts using config entry IDs

## Entities Created

For each Loca device, the integration creates:

### Device Tracker
- `device_tracker.loca_[device_name]` - Shows device location on the map

### Sensors
- `sensor.loca_[device_name]_battery` - Battery percentage (diagnostic)
- `sensor.loca_[device_name]_last_seen` - Last time the device reported its location (diagnostic)
- `sensor.loca_[device_name]_location_accuracy` - GPS accuracy in meters (diagnostic, disabled by default)
- `sensor.loca_[device_name]_asset_info` - Asset information with brand/model (diagnostic)
- `sensor.loca_[device_name]_speed` - Current speed in km/h
- `sensor.loca_[device_name]_location_update` - Location update configuration status (diagnostic)
- `sensor.loca_[device_name]_location` - Current location address

## Services

The integration provides the following services:

### `loca.refresh_devices`
Manually refresh device data from the Loca API for all or specific config entries.

**Parameters:**
- `config_entry_id` (optional): Specific config entry to refresh. If not provided, refreshes all Loca integrations.

**Example:**
```yaml
service: loca.refresh_devices
```

**Example with specific config entry:**
```yaml
service: loca.refresh_devices
data:
  config_entry_id: "abc123def456"
```

### `loca.force_update`  
Force an immediate update for a specific device by refreshing the coordinator containing that device.

**Parameters:**
- `device_id` (required): Device ID to update (found in device diagnostics or entity attributes)

**Example:**
```yaml
service: loca.force_update
data:
  device_id: "12345"
```

**Note**: Services are automatically registered when the integration is loaded and unregistered when unloaded.

## Automations Example

Here are some example automations you can create:

### Low Battery Alert
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Loca Device Low Battery"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.loca_device_battery
        below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          message: "Loca device {{ trigger.to_state.attributes.friendly_name }} has low battery ({{ trigger.to_state.state }}%)"
```

### Device Offline Alert
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Loca Device Offline"
    trigger:
      - platform: template
        value_template: >
          {{ (now() - states.sensor.loca_device_last_seen.last_changed).total_seconds() > 3600 }}
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          message: "Loca device has been offline for more than 1 hour"
```

## API Information

This integration uses the Loca API v1:
- **Base URL**: `https://api.loca.nl/v1/`
- **Authentication**: Session-based with API key
- **Update Interval**: 60 seconds (configurable)
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `Login.json` - Authentication (returns user object)
  - `Assets.json` - Device information and locations
- **Response Format**: JSON with user object on successful login

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your API key, username, and password are correct
   - Check that your Loca account is active  
   - Ensure API key has proper permissions (contact Loca support)
   - Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages
   - Try the test script: `python3 test_api.py` (in integration directory)
   - Verify internet connectivity and DNS resolution for api.loca.nl

2. **No Devices Found**
   - This is normal for new or empty Loca accounts
   - If you have devices, ensure they are properly set up and active
   - Check that devices are associated with your account in the Loca app/website
   - Verify devices are powered on and have GPS/cellular connectivity
   - Wait a few minutes after device setup for them to appear in the API

3. **Location Not Updating**
   - Check if the device has GPS signal
   - Verify the device battery is not low
   - Check device settings in the Loca app

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.loca: debug
```

## [1.1.1-alpha.1] - 2025-09-18

### üö® Critical Bug Fixes

This alpha release addresses critical authentication and entity registration issues that broke the integration in v1.1.0.

#### Fixed
- **HTTPStatus import conflict**: Resolved `NameError: name 'HTTPStatus' is not defined` that prevented API authentication
- **Coordinator attribute error**: Resolved `AttributeError: 'LocaDataUpdateCoordinator' object has no attribute 'last_update_success_time'` that prevented entity registration
- Import resolution: Removed conflicting `http.HTTPStatus` import and properly used the local `HTTPStatus` class from constants
- Cache management: Updated entity data caching to use object identity tracking instead of timestamp-based invalidation
- Code quality: Fixed 44 linting issues and maintained full type safety with mypy

#### Technical Improvements
- **Linting**: All ruff checks now pass (fixed unused imports, style issues)
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance across all 25 source files
- **Import Optimization**: Cleaned up unused imports across the codebase
- Improved error handling in the base entity mixin
- Better cache invalidation logic for entity data
- More robust coordinator integration

#### Testing
- ‚úÖ All 29 API tests pass
- ‚úÖ All 29 sensor tests pass
- ‚úÖ All integration tests pass
- ‚úÖ Full type checking compliance
- ‚úÖ Zero linting issues

### Migration from v1.1.0
If you experienced authentication failures with v1.1.0:
1. Update to v1.1.1-alpha.1
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. The integration should authenticate successfully
4. All entities should be created properly

**Status**: Alpha Release - Use with caution

## [1.0.3] - 2024-XX-XX

### üîí Security Fixes

#### High Severity
- **Fixed GPS coordinate exposure in diagnostics**
  - GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude) are now properly redacted in diagnostic outputs
  - Address fields are also redacted to prevent location disclosure
  - Added `has_gps_data` boolean flag to indicate GPS availability without exposing coordinates
  - This prevents potential privacy breaches when users share diagnostic files for support

#### Medium Severity
- **Fixed partial API key disclosure**
  - Unique IDs now use SHA256 hash instead of raw API key characters
  - Removed API key and username length information from diagnostics
  - This prevents potential credential attacks from partial key exposure

### Changed
- Modified Files:
  - `custom_components/loca/diagnostics.py` - Redact sensitive location data
  - `custom_components/loca/config_flow.py` - Use hash for unique ID generation
  - `tests/test_diagnostics.py` - Update tests for redacted data
  - `tests/test_config_flow.py` - Update tests for new unique ID format

**Recommendation**: Users are strongly encouraged to update to this version to protect their location privacy and credential security.

## [1.0.2] - 2024-XX-XX

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Security & Stability Improvements
- **Fixed**: Removed unsafe cookie jar configuration that could pose security risks
- **Fixed**: Memory leak risk in API client session handling
- **Fixed**: Race condition in service registration that could cause duplicate service registration
- **Fixed**: Race condition in entity management during concurrent operations

#### Data Integrity Fixes
- **Fixed**: Inconsistent timezone handling causing datetime comparison issues
- **Fixed**: Potential division by zero in sensor time parsing that could cause crashes
- **Fixed**: Missing null checks for datetime objects preventing proper error handling
- **Fixed**: Config flow unique ID collision when using multiple accounts with same username

#### Code Quality Improvements
- **Fixed**: Direct access to private API authentication state
- **Removed**: Unused `parse_device_data` method reducing code complexity

### Technical Improvements
- API Client Updates:
  - Improved session management to prevent memory leaks
  - Added public `is_authenticated` property for proper state access
  - Ensured consistent UTC timezone usage across all datetime operations
  - Removed unsafe cookie jar configuration
- Entity Management:
  - Added documentation for Home Assistant's dynamic entity limitations
  - Improved null safety checks for datetime objects
  - Added safe division guards in time parsing logic
- Configuration Flow:
  - Improved unique ID generation using username + API key prefix
  - Better support for multiple Loca accounts on same Home Assistant instance

## [1.0.1] - 2024-XX-XX

### Fixed
- **Home Assistant aiohttp Session Warning**: Integration was creating and closing its own aiohttp session, triggering Home Assistant warnings about closing the shared session
  - Updated to properly use Home Assistant's shared aiohttp session via `aiohttp_client`
  - Eliminates warning messages in logs and ensures proper resource management

### Technical Improvements
- Modified `LocaAPI` class to accept `HomeAssistant` instance for proper session management
- Session is now obtained from `aiohttp_client.async_get_clientsession(hass)`
- Session cleanup only occurs in standalone/testing scenarios (when `hass` is None)
- `DataUpdateCoordinator` now passes `hass` instance to `LocaAPI`
- `ConfigFlow` properly initializes API client with `hass` reference
- Maintains backward compatibility for testing scenarios

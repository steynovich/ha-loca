# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains API documentation for the Loca platform, which appears to be a location-based service or IoT device management system. The repository currently consists of a single HTML file containing comprehensive API documentation that was exported from a WordPress site.

## Repository Structure

- `API Documentation - Loca.nl.html` - Complete API documentation webpage containing endpoints, authentication, and usage examples for the Loca API

## Project Type

This is a documentation-only repository containing a static HTML file. There are no build tools, package managers, or development scripts present.

## API Documentation Content

The documentation covers:
- Authentication (login/logout endpoints)
- Asset management endpoints  
- Icon retrieval endpoints
- Request/response format specifications
- API key management requirements

## Development Context

- No active development environment is configured
- No package.json, build scripts, or dependency management
- The HTML file appears to be an export from a WordPress-based documentation site
- Content is styled with Elementor page builder and Astra theme components

## Notes for Future Development

If this repository evolves beyond documentation storage:
1. Consider extracting API specifications into machine-readable formats (OpenAPI/Swagger)
2. Set up a proper documentation site generator (e.g., GitBook, Docusaurus, or VitePress)
3. Add version control for API documentation changes
4. Implement automated documentation building/deployment
